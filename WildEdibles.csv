2,Arrowhead,"Sagittaria … various species","May - October","white-flowering edibles","Water plant with erect, arrow-shaped leaves. Belongs to the Water Plantain Family.","Shallow water, edges of ponds","Scattered statewide","August - November",Vegetables,"","Arrowhead is an attractive plant growing on the border of one of the ponds at our farm. The arrowhead leaves are distinctive, as are the attractive flowers. The food source from arrowhead is a potato-like tuber that produces in the autumn. One reading source indicated that the Indians harvested the arrowhead, or duck potato, by slushing around the pond with their bare feet. Once the foot felt a tuber, it was knocked loose and picked. The tubers, which can become an inch or two wide, are located several feet from the plant itself. While most of the tubers are smaller, they all contain a bad tasting, whitish-colored juice when eaten raw. One way to prepare this potato substitute is to bake it in a 350° oven for 30 minutes. They may also be boiled or roasted around a campfire. Fernald reports that one Indian tribe used the tubers all winter by stringing them up to dry."
3,Yucca,"Yucca smalliana","May - July","white-flowering edibles","Long, narrow leaves are tough and sharp, growing 2' long from a basal rosette. Tall flower stalks bear cream or white flowers. Member of Lily Family.","Scattered from gardens along roadside, railroads, open banks, open woods","Scattered sparingly","May - August","Salad, fritter, vegetable","","My side garden has a couple of yucca plants which have provided enough food for my experiments. The flower petals are very acceptable in a salad and especially pretty when used with rose and violet petals. I use a sweetened mayonnaise dressing thinned with a fruit juice on this salad. The flowers make a reasonably good fritter when dipped in a batter of 1 cup flour, 1 t baking powder, ½ t salt, 1 cup milk, 1 egg, ¼ cup corn oil and fried. The yucca pods of some species are edible and supposedly quite delicious. Our common yucca of Missouri is indeed not a delicacy, or, that is to say, I have not developed a taste for it. The roasted pods, while edible, are bitter. I also roasted the pods, scraped out the seeds into a batter and fried that. All attempts at boiling, roasting, camouflaging or frying were unsuccessful. If I were hungry or lost and located some yucca, I would eat them again. Until then, however, they will remain on an emergency-food-only basis."
4,"False Solomon’s Seal","Smilacina racemosa","May - June","white-flowering edibles","Bending stalk; alternate, parallel-veined leaves; flowers cluster on stem end. Member of Lily Family. early May. Midsummer for berries","Rich woodland",Statewide,"late March - early May. Mid-summer fo r berries","Vegetable, berry","The fresh berries act as a purgative.","The young shoots of false Solomon's seal and true Solomon's seal are close as look-alikes, grow in the same areas and are interchangeable as an asparagus vegetable. Cut off the young shoots, cook for five minutes in boiling water and serve with butter. It may be fancied up by using in a casserole. Indian tribes used the rootstalks as a potato after soaking them in lye water and boiling until tender. False Solomon's seal has a flower cluster at the top of the stem while the true species has flowers at each spot where the leaf attaches to the stem. The young shoots are differentiated by the true Solomon's seal having more nerve veins in the leaves — a help when gathering plants prior to blooming. The berries, which are white when unripe, turn a reddish-purple splotched when ripe. The berries may be eaten raw. Taken either with other fruit or honey, they aid in problems of constipation. If you are a camper who is affected by this situation, a mid-summer hike in pursuit of false Solomon's seal berries might be an effective remedy."
